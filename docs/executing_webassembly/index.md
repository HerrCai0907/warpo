The compiled bytecode can be executed in any WebAssembly runtme including nodejs, wasmtime, etc.

We highly recommand to run the WebAssembly bytecode compiled by WARPO with [wasm-compiler](https://github.com/wasm-ecosystem/wasm-compiler).

They are designed together and has the best E2E performances.
